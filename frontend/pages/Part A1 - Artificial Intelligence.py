    st.markdown("""
        Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, 
        and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed for a specific task, 
        Machine Learning algorithms are "trained" on large amounts of data to automatically discover rules or relationships.
    
        **Key types of learning in Machine Learning:**
        - Supervised Learning: Models are trained on a labeled dataset (with both input and desired output). 
        The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples: regression (predicting house prices), classification (spam/non-spam email classification).
        - Unsupervised Learning: Models are trained on unlabeled data. 
        The goal is to find hidden structures or patterns within the data. Examples: clustering (grouping customers), dimensionality reduction. 
        It is useful when manual labeling is impractical or too costly.
        - Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns to make decisions through interaction with an environment. 
        The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions, and the goal is to maximize cumulative rewards. Examples: playing games, robot control.
    
        **Common Machine Learning algorithms:** 
        - Linear Regression: predicts continuous values by modeling a linear relationship between in&outputs.
        - Logistic Regression: predicts the probability of binary classes using a sigmoid function.
        - Decision Trees: splits data into branches based on conditions to perform classification or regression.
        - Random Forests: combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
        - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): classifies or predicts based on the labels of the k nearest data points.
        - Support Vector Machines (SVMs): finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data into different classes.
        - Naive Bayes: classifies data based on Bayes’ Theorem with the assumption of feature independence.
        - k-Means: clusters data into k groups based on the nearest mean of each group.

    st.markdown("""### 5. Deep Learning (DL)""")
    st.markdown("""
        Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, specifically neural networks. 
        Deep Learning uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with multiple hidden layers (hence "deep") to learn complex representations of data. 
        It has achieved remarkable success in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
    
        **Key characteristics of Deep Learning:**
        - Deep Neural Networks: consist of many layers (often tens, hundreds, or even thousands of layers) 
        allowing the model to learn features from low-level to more high-level and abstract representations.
         This hierarchical learning is key to its effectiveness in tasks like image and speech recognition.
        - Automatic Feature Learning: unlike traditional Machine Learning which often requires engineers to perform manual feature engineering, 
        Deep Learning can automatically extract and learn important features directly from raw data. 
        - Ability to Process Large Data: deep Learning typically requires large amounts of data to achieve optimal performance and 
        is particularly effective with unstructured data like images, audio, and text. 
        As the volume of data increases, deep learning models often continue to improve in accuracy.
        
        **Types of Network Architectures:**
        - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): highly effective for Computer Vision tasks like image recognition, object detection.
        - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): suitable for sequential data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like machine translation, text generation.
        - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): variants of RNNs designed to overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in long sequences.
        - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): used to generate new, realistic data (e.g., images, music) by training two neural networks.
